We often think that compostable plastics are a great idea because they seem environmentally friendly. However, in reality, they donâ€™t fully decompose. Instead, they break down just enough to meet certain criteria, giving the illusion that they are eco-friendly. Compostable plastics do not decompose into something harmless; rather, they fragment into microplastics. This meets the EU's criteria but results in these plastics quickly turning into microplastics, contributing to pollution.

This issue reflects a broader problem: we believe we have found a simple solution to plastic pollution. While these plastics are marketed as better for the environment, they may actually be worse, as they introduce more microplastics into the ecosystem.

Take this as a warning: short-term solutions to long-term problems can be misleading. The solution to plastic pollution is not to replace plastics with types that decompose faster but to use plastics more intelligently and less frequently. This requires a shift in our values and practices.
