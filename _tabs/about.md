# Hello! I’m Seb





##  I'm on a mission to build systems that **work**, and that have a potive impact on **people** and **life**.

I became frustrated when I kept seeing well-intentioned people implement solutions that ultimately created more problems. I realised they were not understanding the problem in the context of the whole system. This motivated me to pursue the world of systems & control. I wanted to develop a foundational understanding of the mathematics of systems, and learn to apply this theory for the benefit of those impacted by it.

From simulating societies to designing avionics, designing controllers for pacemakers to distributed manufacturing; all require systems thinking & control engineering. Beyond my studies and into my career, I've been able to practice engineering in the context of vertical farming, robotics, power systems, autonomous systems and city simulation. 

I am a strong believer that we need to combine nature-based solutions with technology to solve humanity's most pressing issues. My drive is rooted in creating systems that not only solve problems but also contribute positively to life on Earth. 

Highlighting my career are several notable achievements, including being honoured as a [Royal Academy of Engineering Leadership Scholar](https://raeng.org.uk/programmes-and-prizes/programmes/uk-grants-and-prizes/support-for-education/engineering-leaders-scholarship/scholarship-recipients), being recognised for the [Best Individual Submission](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/acse/news/engineering-student-wins-award-global-social-impact-competition) at the University of Oxford’s ‘Map The System’ competition for my research on the alcohol harm paradox, and [rewriting UK national altitude records](https://www.ukra.org.uk/records/allclass) in the [UKSEDS 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg2Mcxf0NpI) annual competition.
