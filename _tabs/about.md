# Hello! I’m Seb

##  I'm on a mission to build systems that work for life on Earth.

10 years ago, I kept seeing well-intentioned people implement solutions that ultimately created more problems. I realised they were not understanding the problem in the context of the whole system. This motivated me to study systems and control engineering, where I could hone my technical abilities whilst developing a competency in systems thinking. 

I used my time studying Systems & Control Engineering at the University of Sheffield to develop my skills in applying systems thinking and advanced control approaches to numerous domains. From simulating societies to designing avionics, simulating pacemakers to distributed manufacturing; all require systems approaches combined with technical competency. 

I am a strong believer that we need to combine nature-based solutions with technology to solve humanity's most pressing issues. My drive is rooted in creating systems that not only solve problems but also contribute positively to life on Earth. 

Highlighting my career are several notable achievements, including being honoured as a [Royal Academy of Engineering Leadership Scholar](https://raeng.org.uk/programmes-and-prizes/programmes/uk-grants-and-prizes/support-for-education/engineering-leaders-scholarship/scholarship-recipients), being recognised for the [Best Individual Submission](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/acse/news/engineering-student-wins-award-global-social-impact-competition) at the University of Oxford’s ‘Map The System’ competition for my research on the alcohol harm paradox, and [rewriting UK national altitude records](https://www.ukra.org.uk/records/allclass) in the [UKSEDS 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg2Mcxf0NpI) annual competition.
