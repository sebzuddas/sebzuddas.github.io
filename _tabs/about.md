Hello! I’m Seb, a Systems Engineer with a passion for building systems that work for humanity.

With a Master’s in Systems & Control Engineering from the University of Sheffield, I’ve navigated through roles that include the development of digital twins, creating avionic systems in amateur rocketry, working with tech-centred startups, and the modelling and simulation of complex systems.

My approach is rooted in creating systems that not only solve problems but also contribute positively to life on Earth. I believe in the power of developing technology with a systems approach to foster synergy and efficiency.

Highlighting my career are several notable achievements, including being honoured as a [Royal Academy of Engineering Leadership Scholar](https://raeng.org.uk/programmes-and-prizes/programmes/uk-grants-and-prizes/support-for-education/engineering-leaders-scholarship/scholarship-recipients), winning the [Best Individual Submission](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/acse/news/engineering-student-wins-award-global-social-impact-competition) globally in Oxford’s ‘Map The System’ competition for my research on the alcohol harm paradox, and [rewriting UK national altitude records](https://www.ukra.org.uk/records/allclass) in the [UKSEDS 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg2Mcxf0NpI) annual competition.
