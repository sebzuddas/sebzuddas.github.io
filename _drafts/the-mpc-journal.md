# Why Rethink Personal Planning?
You are complex. Life is complex. Things change all the time. Have you ever tried to stick to a plan just for something to get in the way? Do your interests evolve over time, starting projects and not finishing them? Does your planning become less relevant when you learn something new, or an opportunity arises that you didn't anticipate?

These are the drawbacks I found when using traditional 'planning' techniques. Gantt charts, Kanban and other techniques that are used to plan things don't have the flexibility to help you ensure that your goals are consistently relevant to your every day. Sometimes you need to make changes to meet your goals, other times you need to make changes to your goals in order to meet changes in your life. If you were to find a briefcase with $100,000,000, would you still be saving for retirement? If you broke your leg would you still train for a marathon? The point is that life happens, sometimes in good ways, other times not. Goals need to be both rigid and flexible, depending on your situation. The one condition for success with flexible goals is that you are honest with yourself, and have the capability to hold yourself accountable. 

Traditional life planning techniques assume that the world is linear - reduce a goal down to some component parts and, step by step, complete each component until the overarching goal is accomplished. This is a reasonable approach for many things, such as cooking a meal. But what if your goal was to become a better cook? The easy answer would be to attend a cooking class - follow the instructor and attend each session... [here i'm trying to bring the reader to the conclusion that some goals contribute to others, and some goals need to be reached before another should be completed].

1. Kanban
2. Gantt Charts
3. Excel sheets
4. Mind maps




# What is MPC
[Model Predictive Control](https://wiki.sebzuddas.com/Systems/Control-Systems/MPC/Model-Predictive-Control-(MPC)) is a model-based control approach that is used for complex, non-linear systems. What does this mean in simple terms? It is a method that ensures complex systems behave as we intend them to. MPC is often applied to technical systems, such as planes, cars or factories. However, the core principles can be generalised and applied to your life as well.  

The premise is simple: 
1. You have a model, an understanding of how something works, its limitations and the environment in which it sits. 
2. You use your understanding of the model to formulate an **optimal** set of steps to reach the desired 'goal state', working backwards from the goal. 
3. At each iteration, you only enact the first optimal step, after which you reformulate your optimal set of steps. 
This approach ensures that the controller works optimally in the short-term, whilst maintaining its long-term goal. 

MPC is essentially a controller that thinks ahead, choosing actions that are not just good now, but will remain good in the near future, all while obeying the limits of the system. This makes it ideal for many real-world applications.

Below you can see MPC working in a simulation. There is a car that is using MPC, the user clicks certain points in the screen to determine where the car should go - the target. The car then pursues each of the targets optimally.

# The MPC Journal
The MPC journal applies the same approach that MPC does but to your life, replacing traditional, linear planning techniques with something that is both dynamic and optimal. It facilitates flexibility whilst enabling long-term thinking. Most importantly it encourages engagement, and you can choose how engaged you want to be. 

## Nested Iterations
Where the MPC journal diverges from traditional techniques is its use of _nested iterations_. This is a result of the vast amount of reflection that is required when following the process. The MPC journal does give you the ability to choose how often these nested iterations happen. For example, the MPC journal encourages you to reflect every year on your past year, and to consider the next 5 years. Once you have done your yearly reflection, each month also is an opportunity to reflect, and forecast the next month. Finally, each week can be used as an opportunity to reflect on the previous week, and consider the upcoming week. In this way, your life plan is as dynamic life itself, always reflecting on what works for you in the present. 

## Staring Toward Infinity
When considring MPC journal, there is the $k_{\infty}$ infinity which you have to look at. K infinity is a concept that basically says, where do I want to be at the end of time. Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how you see things) we have a limited time to live our lives. Time is precious, and as with anything that becomes scarce, it becomes more precious the more of our lives that we live. The K infinity exercise really makes you consider the end of your time. When you reach the end, what should it look like? And not in the sense of what will it literally look like, moreso what stories do you want to have been true about your own life? These are deep questions that we should consider once in a while, because they help align us to what gives us meaning as individuals. What gives you meaning will be different to what gives me meaning. But it is something important to consider when thinking about what actions should you take next.

# Why Use MPC Journal?
Planning techniques were designed to deliver projects. They are not fit for the complexities of life - big decisions, which paths to take, matching short and long-term personal goals that evolve when you learn new things. MPC Journal presents a framework that frames the short-term in the context of the long-term. It is flexible when it needs to be, whilst holding you accountable to your long-term goals.
