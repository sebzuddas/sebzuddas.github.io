Picture the following. You are in an aeroplane, flying at subsonic cruising speed, 10 kilometres high in the sky. The flight is peaceful, the evening is clear and serene. You admire the horizon as you take in the deep red of the setting sun, watching the city come to life as golden hour turns to night. As darkness grows, you close your eyes, and sleep, ready to land at your destination 1000s of kilometres away from your home in a few hours. The most impressive part? This happens day after day, and the pilot isn't even flying.

We have developed so much trust in the systems that control our planes, that people will happily board, eat and sleep on them without ever considering that most of the time they are in the air, they are being flown by a computer. I believe with the onset of self-driving capabilities, we will soon see the same with cars on a large scale. Rocket landings are similarly impressive mostly because of their control systems.

We need controllers in these settings since human beings are notoriously bad at keeping fast things stable for a long time, and it is no surprise that we celebrate those who become expert in such things. [Max Verstappen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen), F1's current prodigy, also needs to know how to walk, read and cook to be a functional human being. [Niel Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong), a notorious test pilot before becoming the first man on the moon, also had to be able to manage relationships and do maths. Human beings are specialised in adapting, and then, over the course of a lifetime, tend to become pretty good at a few things, and mediocre at most things. Autopilot systems on the other hand are specialised in one thing - flying the plane.

Human beings are excellent at adapting to their environment. They have the capacity to adapt to the Sahara, the Arctic Circle, or the Amazon rainforest through collaboration and brain power. We can 'shortcut' the adaptation schedule of evolution by learning, and working together with others, two characteristics fundamental to our species. It is also possible for human beings to mal-adapt, that is, to find ways of adapting that may work in the short-term, but end up being counter productive in the long-term. Addiction is the most prominent example of this. 

So, if you were to ask yourself "where on Earth do I spend the most time in a given day", what would you answer? This is an important question, since you are likely unconsciously adapting to this place. If you were to answer "Home", then you are in the majority. 

What if, we could apply the same way of thinking to the average home? We spend a large portion of our lives within our home, and this is expected to grow with the advent of hybrid working.
