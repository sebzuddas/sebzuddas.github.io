# What is Systems Thinking
Systems thinking, put simply, is thinking about how groups of components interact with eachother, how as a collective, the whole system leads to outcomes that may be unpredictable by looking at any one component on it's own. A great starting example is thinking about ants. 


## Thinking about Ants

An ant itself is a system. It has eyes, legs, a brain, antennae, and a body. These components come together to form an ant, and by looking at these components *individually* you couldn't predict that an ant can pick up things multiple times its own bodyweight. 

But ants don't exist in isolation, and a singluar ant in the wild doesn't survive very long despite being so strong for its size. Ants exist in as part of a colony of ants, comprising of mostly worker ants, some soldier ants and a singular queen. These different types of ants need to collaborate in order to keep their colony alive; communicating mostly via pheremones. A colony is therefore a system of ants, working as a whole in order to survive. 

Many ecosystems contain ant colonies, and in the context of the ecosystem ants work to 'recycle' dead matter, using it to feed and maintain their colonies. The group of ant colonies would be considered one element of the ecosystem as a whole, just as a body part to an ant, or an ant to a colony. 

> **A note on scales**: When thinking about how the components of an ants body make up an ant, you are thinking on an 'ant scale'. Similarly, when thinking about how ants make up colonies, you're thinking on a 'colony' scale. And finally, when thinking about how ant colonies fit into ecosystems, you're thinking on the 'ecosystem' scale. **The scale at which you are thinking is dependent on the context of the problem**. 

## Humans and Ants
Human societies can be thought of as much more complex versions of ant colonies.
