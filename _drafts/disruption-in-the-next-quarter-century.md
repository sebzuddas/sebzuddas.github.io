# What do you think are the opportunities and risks of emerging and disruptive technologies?

## The Techonolgies
There is a lot of hype on Artificial Intelligence, the term itself is vague since it encompasses many subdomains. Autopilot systems in aircraft have existed for many years, yet many don't consider autopilots as AI. And yet, many wouldn't feel safe flying if ChatGPT was known to be controlling the aircraft. Modern LLMs can be thought of as extremely high-reliability stochastic processes; when you input the same question twice, you get two convincing answers. Aircraft autopilot systems are the deterministic equivalent; for two replicas of a set of input signals, the autopilot will give the same outputs. Autopilots are virtual pilots that have undergone strict tests to ensure robustness under critical conditions, such that the passengers and crew will land safely. 

An LLM's strength is in interpreting written language and predicting what word should come next in a stream of text. An autopilot's strength is ensuring that an aircraft remains stable in the face of turbulence. This essay forecasts a world in which these two types of systems (stochastic and deterministic) combine at scale. I examine what happens as a result of those combinations as singular entities, and forecast emergent behaviours of combinations of these stochastic-deterministic entities. 

### The Combination of a Stochastic and a Deterministic System

#### Stochastic Systems
Stochastic systems are those in which for any two of the same inputs, you get two different outputs. They exist in the world of probability and statistics. They excel at handling uncertainty through prediction. 

When YouTube recommends you a video, it is doing so with a certain probability that you will watch it. 


#### Deterministic Systems 
Deterministic Systems are those in which for any two of the same inputs, you get the same output. They exist in the world of pure mathematics and system dynamics. They excel at delivering robust and reliable results. 

If you sent a signal to a motor controller to rotate at 90 degrees, the motor would do so, and if you sent the same signal again, it would do so again. 

Deterministic systems include things like cars, robots, planes - most machines in physical reality can be considered deterministic. Other examples include buildings etc. 


#### Combining the Two

The two landmark moments in technology in the 2010s were the advent of AI in AlphaGo and the development of robotic systems seen from Boston dynamics. Boston dynamics in the early 2010s demonstrated to the world what can happen when you combine deterministic and stochastic systems well, combining vision-based reinforcement learning with advanced control algorithms. These events demonstrate what can occur when leveraging each system type to its unique advantage - stochastic vision models to interpret the world, and deterministic control algorithms to do something with that information. 

These technologies have since become much more accessible. In the first half of this decade we have seen the start of what can happen when these technologies are pushed and combined. Humanoid robotics are a representation of what can happen when you combine language models with hardware. This industry currently promises a generalist robot assistant much in the same way that LLMs promise a virtual assistant. Much of the current innovation landscape lies in the intersection of the two - stochastic and deterministic systems. Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) defines a communications protocol for language models (Stochastic) to interact with existing software (much of which is deterministic). Currently, major players are still understanding the benefits and limitations of such technologies - including security ramifications of exposing software using MCP. This technology is still in its early maturation phase. 


## Concerning Humans
Human beings can be thought of as systems that resolve uncertainty in order to form goals. For example, you might drive more cautiously in a dark road at night - you are uncertain of what's ahead and you don't want to crash. Hence, you adjust your movements (deterministic) in order to drive more safely. Human beings are one example of an SD system, and it's worth considering how human beings organise themselves because we are likely to see that different SD systems will organise themselves using similar patterns. 

Resolution of uncertainty towards the resolution of a goal - santa fe quote regarding what an intelligent system is. 

## The internet of thinking and doing

In all of the aforementioned, the focus is on individual things - a single plane, a single robot, a single LLM. Each of these items are a unique blend of many other technologies underneath, interacting in ways that best leverage each of their advantages. Each of these items hold their own advantages - robots can carry things, planes can fly people, LLMs interpret text. 

Disruption will occur on two levels - the creative combination of modern technologies that are becoming unique SD systems in and of themselves, and then the combination of these systems - the systems of SD systems. 

The individual systems are being brought on by emerging technologies such as multimodal AI systems, humanoid robotics, and creative use of MCP servers with LLMs. These individual systems are created in order to meet a certain goal - whether that's to repurpose text in a way that is mathematically accurate or autonomously deliver pizzas. These are near-term innovations that we can expect to cause major disruptions in the labour market. 

However, it's the combination of these individual SD systems that presents something never before seen. The industrial revolution saw automation replace human labour. Farmers purchased labour and time saving machines, and the labourers moved into different jobs. This time around, it's not the replacement of individuals, but of entire organisations. Following the same analogy, this time around, the farm owner will be replaced as well as the labourers, and likely the entire village itself.

The combination of SD systems have the potential to replace entire societies, both virtually and physically. Just as much as the farmer no longer needs to operate the farm, the CEO no longer needs to operate the company. Organisations will be made up entirely of hyper-performing SD systems that can function without sleep and without causing arguments.

## Social Layers in an Automated World

### Human Layers
An individual communicates with others through language and actions. Groups of individuals with mutual and synchronised understanding of how the group behaves lead to emergent properties - consider music, theatre, cinema, research, construction, driving. The best of these are achieved when groups excel in their communication and actions. Organisations that operate well contain individuals that excel in their craft, and can communicate with others. Thinking one scale higher, societies are built from a range of organised groups of human beings - organisations. When organisations across a society excel in what they do and communicate it well, it gives rise to a compelling and performant society. 


### Automating
Given the rise of SD systems in their various forms (virtual and robotic), we can expect there to be a need for these various forms to organise in unique ways to achieve larger-order goals. Organisations of SD systems will be created in the name of efficiency, in order to deliver value more consistently than organisations of human beings can, completely autonomously. Collecting these autonomous organisations together will be analogous to having entire virtual societies existing alongside current ones. 




## Disruptions

### 1. Extreme capabilities in the hands of few
In the near future, individuals will be able to create entire societies of virtual SD systems with very little effort. Societies that may serve the interests of the creator only, not the society in which they live. 


### 2. Never-before-seen Social Structures
It is entirely feasible that the artificial societies created 

It is naive to think that these artificial societies will mimic ours, and that we can use our social structures as the only way to operate. Modern human society emerged from thousands of years of evolution, and are unique to human beings. Different animals operate in different social structures in order to achieve their social goals.

## Opportunities

### 1. 



Consider departments within a company. The company has three layers. From top to bottom - upper management deals with company strategy (how the company should behave based on the world external to the company) and inner policies (how the compoany should operate internally). Middle management each own a department, lets just consider marketing and engineering for now. Then, marketing has a graphics designer and a copywriter. Engineering contains a front end developer and a back end developer. 

This company's value in the world is about how it creatively operates (internally) to deliver value externally. It contains a set of individuals, and the way they interact represents the company's culture and its outputs. The individuals have a balance of specialist and genralist tasks. In order to speak to one another, they require a common language. In order to perform at their function, they require a certain specialism. 

What we are currently seeing emerge are technologies that are able to handle both generalist and specialist functions. individual technologies are handling this in creative ways, such as with humanoid robots and self driving vehicles. One of the opportunities here is to get these technologies validated for safety critical tasks. 

Although individual technologies with this creative specialist-generalist combination are opportunities in and of themselves, the true innovation lies in the combination of the different specialist-generalist technologies. It's not the individual robot that is interesting, it's the group of robots, combined with the group of cars, combined with the group of boats that all interact amongst themselves. The first to achieve such integrations, essentially being able to create organisations of autonomous specialist-generalist systems to deliver value and perform tasks will win. 

Why? Because the role of an organisation is to combine specialist-generalists to deliver value on something that no other organisation can. Consider the police force, or a construction contractor, or an airline. 

If we were to extend this scale one more time, then we can consider societies. In the end, organisations generated by societies, for example companies, institutions or charities are there to deliver value by combining groups of specialist-generalists. Their common language is often the exchange of resources at a large scale, represented by financial transactions. 

Going back to the example, we can see that the creative combination of non-human organisations will lead to a form of artificial society. 


In essence, the combination of stochastic methods (such as LLMs) and deterministic methods (such as an autopilot) represent an opportunity to merge a specialist and generalist skillset into single technologies. When these specialist-generalist systems will interact, they will give rise to teams and organisations. When these teams and organisations interact, they will give rise to artificial societies. 


Ultimately what we want to understand is - how do we want these *groups* to behave? As a result, what behaviuors do individuals need to exhibit to ensure that the group behaves as we intend. 

## The Disruptions

## The Opportunities

The industrial revolution offered the opportunity to automate physical labour. Tasks that required repeated, physical motion could be replaced by machines who did not get tired. However, any situation that required some level of adaptation could not be automated. 

The computer revolution offered the opportunity to automate

Pure software offered the opportunity to automate things that needed to be the same every time. stochastic technologies, LLMs offer the opportunity to automate things that should be genuinely unique every time they are generated.
